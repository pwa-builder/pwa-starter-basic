# PWA Starter

The PWABuilder pwa-starter-basic is a simplified version of our original [PWA Starter template](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter). It operates similarly to the original, but with fewer dependencies and closer to a VanillaJS experience. We also have a CLI tool to allow you to create a PWA template from the command line.

## Jump Right In

Install the PWABuilder CLI:

`npm i -g @pwabuilder/cli`

And create a new app with this command:

`pwa create -t=basic`

And start your app locally with:

`pwa start`

And that's it! Good luck on your Progressive Web App adventure!

## More Info

We are still working on more complete guidance for the basic template. If you want a more guided experience with full documentation, check out the original [PWA Starter template](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter).
